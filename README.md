# Verified hand-written Lean solutions to HumanEval

[HumanEval] is a collection of small programming tasks originally intended as a benchmark for LLMs.
In this repo, we collect hand-written _formally verified_ [Lean 4] solutions to these problems.

The idea is to build a small set of simple examples for verified software development using Lean.
It is inspired by [human-eval-verus], which does a similar thing for the Verus Rust verification
platform.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! You can
[look at the open issues](https://github.com/TwoFX/human-eval-lean/issues) to see
which problems do not currently have a solution.

Feel free to add your thoughts about
a problem to the corresponding issue. A rough estimation of the difficulty is already
helpful; I will add the corresponding label to the issue.

We accept

- PRs adding complete solutions to unsolved problems,
- PRs adding additional solutions to problems which are already solved,
- PRs adding partial solutions (for example just the code and the correctness statement, with the correctness proof sorried, or just developing a bit of related theory), and
- PRs improving the code of existing solutions.

Golfing is welcome as long as the resulting code can still be considered idiomatic.

We use the [Lean 4 standard library style guide and naming convention](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/doc/std),
but we won't be very strict about enforcing it.

### Missing lemmas

One of the goals of the goals of this project is to assess the out-of-the-box
experience of Lean 4 as a software verification tool, so this project will not
take on dependencies such as Batteries.

Solutions to most tasks will encounter lemmas missing from Lean core. Some of the missing
lemmas might be available in a place like Batteries and mathlib. The procedure in this case is
to put the missing lemmas in the file where they are needed, with a note if they are available
somewhere else. In this way, the files in this repository clearly document what was missing
from Lean core.
